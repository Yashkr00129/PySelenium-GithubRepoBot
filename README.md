# PySelenium-GithubRepoBot

This is a command line tool that allows you to make a github repository from your account.

To use this simply just open this file in the terminal. 
It will ask you for your email,password and the repository name that you want to create.

This uses selenium under the hood so if you dont have that on your machine just run pip install selenium.
You can also use the pipenv file in this project.

Feel free to report any issues and make pull requests.
